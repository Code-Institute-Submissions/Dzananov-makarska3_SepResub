 * A dubbel closing "head" element. I did not notice the error straight away but I did notice that my page was not as it should be. So I scanned the codes and detected the problem almost right away.

 * Another Bug was detected after submission. A broken link in the menu section. The reason for that was that I changed the ID name but forgott to change it in the used menu link.
